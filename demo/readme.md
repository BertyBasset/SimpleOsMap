The Demo version of the Map displays at 600x400 pixels rather then full screen becasue it is using Demo API keys, and we want to keep tile requests at a reasonable level.

The version in src displays at Full Screen, but you will have to obtain your own Bing Maps and MapBox API keys and replace the placeholders in src/javascript/main.js
