This section originally ended in a doorway, now blocked off, which opened into the ditch, and thus provided an alternative entrance/exit to the round [sic].

An ‘old’ entrance is visible in the south wall of this curving passage about halfway along its length. Both passages are over 2m high in places. Precise dating of the fogou is difficult, but the evidence from pottery found during the excavations, which included local Iron Age cordoned wares and some sherds of Samian ware from southern Gaul, suggest a continuity of use from the 4th Century BC to at least the 2nd Century AD.<br />The fogou and the round within which it sits lies on the western slopes of a hill with panoramic views over the Helford river and beyond - a landscape rich in settlements broadly contemporary with the Iron Age and Roman occupation at Halliggye. These include other round sites which share similar hillside locations, and the very large hillfort known as Gear Camp which is sited just 1km to the northeast. <br />The modern-day settlement and manor of Halliggye is first recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086 where it is spelt 'Heligin'. The name is Cornish and means 'Place of Willow Trees'.

Access to the fogou is therefore only possible between April and September.<br />The site lies within the Trelowarren Estate and a small entrance fee is levied.

Certainly the majority of tourists who flock to the long, sandy beach and foam flecked Atlantic breakers have no idea what lies at the furthest point, where cliffs rise majestically into the air and puffins and plump seagulls perch on ledges to surprise unwary walkers who lean over the edge to catch their first glimpse of the beach.<br />To reach the beach from the public car park at the bottom of the village, you first have to wade through the cold water of the flowing river as it makes its way to the sea. Then you have the choice of climbing the shifting sand of the dunes or to walk around. Once on the beach, tiny shale cuts into bare feet until you reach the supposed ease of open sand. Then the real trouble starts, for the sand is soft and you can sink downward up to six inches as you make your way across the flats towards the cave. It is a mile from the car park across the beach to its furthest point, a mile to remember that any journey to a holy site is a pilgrimage and the walker should not expect an easy time. <br />The sight of rock pools nestling in the curve of the cliff takes one’s breath away; such stillness and peace amidst the turmoil of life. The breakers quietly kiss the sand behind you, their ferocity tamed for such a small moment, the sound a reminder of how little time you have to find the well. <br />The cave is flanked by large boulders and small pools. The encrusted barnacles are sharp on your feet, but you climb over them anyway in your eagerness to reach the cave mouth. On the left hand side you can see streams of green and rust flowing out of the rocks. It is only as you venture closure that you realise there are steps cut into the colours. Steps carved out hundreds of years ago and worn smooth by the processions of small feet as local mothers brought their ailing children to be dragged around the sacred well at the time when the veil between the real and spirit world was at its thinnest. In the darkness of the cave’s womb, they would be passed from the darkness into the light in order that their afflictions could be cured. <br />The steps here are treacherous, the green algae and iron oxide coating the stone with a slippery film. As you venture further and turn the corner into the cave itself, it is hard not to gasp at the beauty ahead of you. The steps now fade from deep red through pink into the purest white and turn into round pools of calcite for you to wade through to reach the highest point. <br />Another opening beckons you into total darkness and unless you have brought a torch, you will not see the tiny sacred freshwater pool fed from spring water trickling through the rocks above. It is truly a place of the Mother and her mysteries, somewhere you will want to crouch and wonder or merely empty your mind and give yourself up from the cares of the world. ", "isRegion": false},

Following the coast path past some houses reaches a point where the path turns west and ascends steps. From the foot of the steps (at SW 7198 5180) an informal fisherman's path reaches the head. At the start of this an old path descends on the east side of the head, at the top of which a short drop is not difficult in dry conditions but is exposed. This descends to a gully which may have been a boat slip, at the foot of which are the Hall and Parlour entrances. This area is known as the Old Quay, the site of a short-lived early attempt to establish a harbour at St. Agnes, the eventual most successful site being a little further to the south. The bottom part of this route is only dry for a few hours either side of low water. <br />An alternate dry route is fairly straight forward at low tide in calm conditions. Crossing the piles of huge granite blocks on the west side of the beach, which are the remains of the Trevaunance Harbour, the cliff is followed to a 10m long section of south-facing cliff containing several artificial openings. The high walled-up mine workings in the corner form part of Wheal Luna. To the right of these is a the Tunnel Entrance, gaining a nice section of tunnel containing pools. This is obviously man made, and seems to have been part of an access route through the cave rather than a mine working. After 10m this leads to a short drop into the cave. At the foot of the climb, a passage to the right leads to an entrance which will be difficult to pass dry even at low tide, and to the left a short passage reaches Swirl Pot entrance, 3m deep and requiring tackle (or a jump at higher tide).<br />These entrances can also be reached on surface by scrambling past the south-facing section of cliff. This route passes a short low cave, and just beyond, behind large granite blocks at the point where the north wall of the harbour joined the cliff, is an entrance (perhaps could be called Collins' Cave?) which leads to an awkward 3m drop into the cave.  All theses passages must sump off towards high tide.<br />Back at the foot of the climb down from the tunnel entrance, a climb up to the left reaches a rift passage which after 20m enters the Hall and Parlour, which are linked by a short passage opposite where the rift joins them.", "isRegion": false},

At the far end of the pool is a tiny gravel beach beyond which is a narrow corridor of granite that peters out after about 30 metres.<br />Piper’s Hole cuts across a seam of tin which was mined during the 17th century. The idea was to bring sufficient illumination to be able to check the granite walls of the cave for evidence of human excavation such as pick-work. It was in the “corridor” at the back of cave that we hoped to find marks in the granite that would show that miners once worked the rock.<br />Sadly the surface of the granite was naturally in such a decomposed state that any 250 year old scars from pickaxes would have long disappeared. However, it was an excellent excuse to shed light on a fascinating part of Tresco. Most noticeable on the roof of the cave was a glittering, metallic sheen. Much as it looked like silver, the disappointing news is that this no more than a winning combination of condensation and some…er…”microbial communities” , whatever they may be.

At the entrance to the cave this structure dips 75º east.

The two entrances join just inside the entrance, at low tide the Seal Canal, 50m long, is reached. This is mainly out of depth water and will be sumped off towards high tide. Beyond at low tide a cobble beach is reached and the passage enlarges and passes several side passages. The end of the surveyed part of the cave marks the point where the way on reduces to about 6m high and 1.5m wide; this narrow section is frequently used by seals. A waterfall can be heard beyond this point.<br />It has been suggested that there is an underwater connection from the Seal Canal to the cliffs, and also a possible connection to a further cave about 50m further east.

A sloping trench leads down from ground level to the arched tunnel entrance, where the hinges for a gate or door can still be seen. The tunnel is still open, and runs due north for hundreds of yards. It is possible to walk along it only in a stooping posture, though in the last two centuries, the average stature has risen considerably, so possibly 17th century smugglers could have walked upright. <br />Many smugglers' tunnels prove disappointing, or just non-existent, but this one seems authentic: it is the right shape; it runs towards the coast; it even has a drainage gulley along its length to keep the flat floor dry.
